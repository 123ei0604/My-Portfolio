## 🚀 About Me

I bring together the creativity of frontend design and the robustness of backend architecture to build full-fledged web applications. With a strong command of the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)** and **Next.js**, I aim to deliver high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly software.

I'm also deeply fascinated by **Machine Learning**, constantly exploring intelligent systems and algorithms. With a solid academic foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, and **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, I aim to solve real-world problems with code.

In addition to building applications, I enjoy **writing technical blogs and content** that simplify complex concepts and help others in the developer community learn and grow.
